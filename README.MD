# FME Projects

This repository contains a collection of my FME workspaces for learning, experimentation, and building reusable spatial data tools.

## Projects

### GTFS Coverage

Folder: GTFS Coverage

Workspaces to analyse GTFS (NSW public transport) data and evaluate stop-level service coverage:

- **GTFS_Coverage_Min1PerHour.fmw**  
  Checks which bus stops have at least one service per hour within a specified time window.

- **GTFS_Coverage_MinNPerHour.fmw**  
  Generalised version with a user parameter for the minimum number of services per hour (e.g. 2, 3, 4+), and flags bus stops that meet this rule during the specific time of the day.

More FME projects will be added over time as I build new tools and workflows.
